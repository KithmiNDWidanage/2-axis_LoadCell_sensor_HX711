# 2-axis_LoadCell_sensor_HX711
This repository include the codes for a load cell-based 2-axis force sensor made by using two 20kg strain guage load cells combined with HX711 SparkFun Load Cell Amplifiers. The load cell data is read and printed to the Serial Port using an Arduino microcontroller.  This data is then read by a C++ programme on Windows for further processing.
